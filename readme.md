Love2D development environment and game template for Windows
=======================================

This is the development environment I set up for love2D projects.
This structure reduces redundancy, and gives you a useful starting point for your projects.

###Features
 + Fixed Timestep (Default is 60 updates per second)
 + Single Click function (Love2D has no built-in easy method for single mouse-click events)
 
###How to use
 * Move the entire file structure anywhere on your windows system
 * Download the Love2D windows zip from https://www.love2d.org/
 * Extract the executables and dlls and other files to _ENGINE
 * Create a new copy of the Template folder, give it a unique name (NOTE: PUTTING SPACES IN THE FOLDER NAME WILL CAUSE ERRORS)
 * Double Click run.bat
